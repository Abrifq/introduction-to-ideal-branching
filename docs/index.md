# Introduction to Ideal Branching &ndash; or Branching Ideally

Hey there! If you are here, either:

1. I linked you here from one of my projects, as this is my standard.
2. You like your branch to be straight (and you are a perfectionist)
3. You don't like merge commits, which I understand, it really makes the git log a bit confusing. (and you are a perfectionist)
4. You heard `git rebase` is better, somehow, but it sounds confusing and I linked you here.
5. You are a perfectionist (or me)

In any case, welcome!
